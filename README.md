# Recursion
In this project two known computer science problems are solved with recursion. 
The first one is creating a fibonacci sequence and the second one is a merge_sort. This
solutions are part of [The Odin Project - Recursion](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/recursion)
in the Ruby section.

## Fibonacci
The task is to create a recursive method #fib_rec(num) which will display the fibonnaci 
sequence. The parameter indicates how many numbers in the fibonnaci sequence will be displayed.

## Merge sorting
In merge sorting, an array will be divided into two halves until only one item remains 
on the left and on the right half of the division. The left item will be compared with the right
item and then merged into a new array. This result of this merge will be provided for the higher-
order division.
